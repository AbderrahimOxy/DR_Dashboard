It is a streamlit app that provides statistics on the opening range breakout day trading strategy. In this strategy, the first hour of trading is considered as an important price range as during this time very often the high or the low of a day forms. Therefore, the trader waits until one side of the price range is broken.
The direction of the range breakout is considered trend-setting for the day/session. The dashboard provides information about where price retracements and extensions have occurred in the past and at what times they occurred.
